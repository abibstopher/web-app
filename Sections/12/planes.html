# Planes and Vector Applications

## Equations of Lines

### Vector Equation

The vector equation describes the line as a point and direction. For each value of t, it produces a point on the line

Given starting point $\vec r_0$ and vector paralell to the line $\vec v$

$$ \vec r = \vec r_0 + t\vec v $$

### Parametric Equation

The parametric equation defines x,y,and z separately as functions of t

Given starting point $\langle x_0,y_0,z_0 \rangle$ and vector $\langle a,b,c \rangle$

$$ \langle x,y,z \rangle = \langle x_0 + at, y_0 + bt, z_0 + ct\rangle$$

$$ x(t) = x_0 + at $$
$$ y(t) = y_0 + bt $$
$$ z(t) = z_0 + ct $$

### Symmetric Equation(s)

The symmetric equation is found by solving for t, and therefore each one can be set equal

$$ t = {x - x_0 \over a} = {y - y_0 \over b} = {z - z_0 \over c} $$

If one of the pieces a, b, or c is 0, it can still be written as $x = x_0$ for example, if a = 0

### Line segments

If only the portion of a line from $r_0$ to $r_1$ is given by

$$ r(t) = (1 - t)\vec r_0 + t\vec r_1 $$
$$ 0 \le t \le 1 $$

## Explanation

### Defining a line

This section explains more explicitly how the above example is able to define a line.

![A graphical depiction of the below statements](Line_Equation.jpg)

Given $P_0, P_1$, $\vec v$ connecting them, a point $Q$ on the line defined by $P_0,P_1$, and a vector $\vec{OQ}$ from the orogin, and $\vec r$ from the origin to $P_0$

Since $\vec v$ and $\vec{P_0Q}$ are parallel, one can be scaled to be the other. In other words, for the vec $\vec{P_0Q}$, there exists a scalar $\lambda$ such that $\vec{P_0Q} = \lambda \times \vec v$.

Note that $\vec{OQ} = \vec r + \vec{P_0Q} = \vec r + \lambda \vec v$. 
This gives the vector equation of the line:

$$\vec r(t) = \vec r_0 + t\vec v$$

As we will see soon, it is better to denote $\lambda$ by $t$ (because $t$ has the meaning of time)

$\vec{OQ} = \langle x,y,z \rangle$, so the above equation can be rewritten as:

$$ \langle x,y,z \rangle = \langle x_0,y_0,z_0\rangle + t \langle x_1 - x_0, y_1 - y_0, x_1 - z_0\rangle$$
$$ \langle x,y,z \rangle = \langle x_0 + t(x_1 - x_0),y_0 + t(y_1 - y_0),z_0 + t(z_1 - z_0)\rangle$$

$$ x = x_0 + t(x_1 - x_0) $$
$$ y = y_0 + t(y_1 - y_0) $$
$$ z = z_0 + t(z_1 - z_0) $$
(parametric equation of the line) - or more generally:
$$ x = x_0 + ta $$
$$ y = y_0 + tb $$
$$ z = z_0 + tc $$

## Equations of Planes

- planes are infinite
- Every plane has an equation that describes it
- The solutions to such an equation are all in the same plane - they represent it
- A plane can be defines using as few as three (non-colinear) points
- Thes epoints can allow you to find an equation
  Using a point P on the plane, a vector $\vec n$ (called a normal vector) perpendicular ($\perp$) to the plane with endpoint Q, and another vector in the plane ending in point A

### Observations

1. point A is on the plane if and only if (iff) the angle between $\vec{PA}$ and $\vec n$ is 90&#176;
2. the point A is on the plane iff $\vec n \cdot \vec{PA} = 0$

Assume $\vec n = \langle a,b,c\rangle$, $P = \langle x_0,y_0,z_0 \rangle$
Then from observation 2, point $A = \langle x,y,z \rangle$ is on the plane iff
$$ \langle a,b,c \rangle \cdot \langle x - x_0,y - y_0,z - z_0 \rangle = 0$$
(meaning that the vector created by $\vec{PA}$ is perpendicular to $\vec n$)

Scalar form: (scalar because it can be multiplied by a constant and describe the same plane)
$$ a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + c(z - z_0) = 0 $$

or

Linear form:
$$ ax + by + cz = d $$
$$ where $$
$$ d = ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 $$

### Proposition

Any of these two equations describes a plane for which $\vec n = \langle a,b,c\rangle$ is a normal vector to the plane

### Find an equation of the plane through the point (2,4,-1) with the normal vector $\vec n = \langle 2,3,4\rangle$.

#### Solution

$$ a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + c(z - z_0) = 0 $$
(General scalar form of plane equation)
In this case, we have $\vec n = \langle 2,3,4 \rangle = \langle a,b,c \rangle$
$$ \langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \rangle = \langle 2,4,-1 \rangle $$
(can be any point on the plane) So:
$$ 2(x - 2) + 3(y - 4) + 4(z +1) = 0 $$
$$ \downarrow $$
$$ 2x + 3y + 4z = 12 $$

### Find an equation of the plane through the points P = (1,3,2), Q = (3,-1,6), and R = (5,2,0).

#### Solution

The points form a triangle, and because of the above properties of planes, it describes a plane

##### What we need

1. A point on the plane - any of the given points, ex. use P = (1,3,2)
2. A normal vector $\vec n$ of the plane - needs to be found

- to get this, use $\vec{PQ} \times \vec{PR}$ because it gives a vector perpendicular to both, and both vectors are in the plane
  $$ \vec n = \vec{PQ} \times \vec{PR} $$
  $$ \vec{PR} = \langle 2,-4,4\rangle $$
  $$ \vec{PR} = \langle 4,-1,-2\rangle $$
  $$ \vec n = \langle 2,-4,4\rangle \times \langle 4,-1,-2\rangle $$

$$
\begin{vmatrix}
i & j & k \\
2 & -4 & 4 \\
4 & -1 & -2
\end{vmatrix}
= i(8 + 4)-j(-4 - 16)+k(-2 + 16)
= \langle 12, 20, 14 \rangle
$$

So now we can plug in values to scalar form:
$$ 12(x - 1) + 20(y - 3) + 14(z + 2) = 0 $$
$$ \downarrow $$
$$ 12x + 20y + 14z = 12 + 60 + 28 = 100 $$
And simplifying:
$$ 6(x - 1) + 10(y - 3) + 7(z + 2) = 0 $$
$$ \downarrow $$
$$ 6x + 10y + 7z = 50 $$

### Find the angle between the planes $x + y + z = 1$ and $x - 2y + 3z = 1$

#### Solution

The two planes cross eachother, and we want the angle between them. We can take the normal vectors of these equations as:
$$ \vec n_1 = \langle 1, 1,1 \rangle $$
$$ \vec n_2 = \langle 1,-2,3 \rangle $$
We want to find the angle between the planes ($\alpha$) using the angle between the vectors ($\theta$). This is found using $\theta = 180 - \alpha$ (use the larger by convention), and $\theta$ can be found using a dot product.
![A visual depiction of the above statements](Angle_between_planes.jpg)
$$ \vec n_1 \cdot \vec n_2 = |\vec n_1| * |\vec n_2| * \cos(\theta) $$
$$ \cos(\theta) = {(\vec n_1 \cdot \vec n_2) \over |\vec n_1| | \vec n_2|} $$
$$ \vec n_1 \cdot \vec n_2 = 1 * 1 + 1 * -2 + 1 * 3 = 2 $$
$$ |\vec n_1| = \sqrt{1 + 1 + 1} = \sqrt{3} $$
$$ |\vec n_2| = \sqrt{1 + 4 + 9} = \sqrt{14} $$
$$ |\vec n_1| |\vec n_2| = \sqrt{42} $$
$$ \cos(\theta) = {2 \over \sqrt{42}} $$
$$ \theta = \arccos \left( 2 \over \sqrt{42} \right) $$
