# Parametric Surfaces - 16.6

Remember that we defined parametric equations for curves earlier:

$$
\vec r(t) = 
\begin{cases}
  x = x(t) \\
  y = y(t) \\
  z = z(t) \\
\end{cases}
$$

This shows that parametric just means that each coordinate has it's own function, taking in two separate *parameters*.

For parametric surfaces, the vector function $\vec r$ is dependent on two variables.

$$
\vec r(u,v) = 
\begin{cases}
  x = x(u,v) \\
  y = y(u,v) \\
  z = z(u,v) 
\end{cases}
$$

Where $(u,v)\in D$ is the domain in the $(u,v)$-plane.

One point to note is that an equation can be parameterized in many different ways; often infinitely many.

### Question 1

Identify the surface with the given vector equation:

$$r(u,v) = (u + v)\hat i + (3 - u)\hat j + (1 +4u + 5v)\hat k$$

#### Solution

We can find z in terms of $x$ and $y$ by finding a pair of numbers which can be multiplied or added to $x$ and $y$ to get the equation for $z$.

$$z = ax + by + c$$
$$1 +4u + 5v = a(u + v) + b(3 - u) + c$$

We can also define $u$ and $v$ in terms of $x$ and $y$:

$$y = 3 - u \to u = 3 - y$$
$$x = u + v \to v = x - u \to v = x - (3 - y)$$
$$z = 1 + 4u + 5v = 1 + 4(3 - y) + 5(x - 3 + y)$$

So we can find that $z = 5x + y - 2$

$$5x +y-z=2$$

So, we can describe S as the plane that passes through (0,0,-2) and has the normal vector $\vec u = \langle 5,1,-1\rangle$

### Question 2

$$\vec r(s,t) = \langle s\cos t, s\sin t, s\rangle$$

#### Solution

From the above equation, we can see that if we add the squares of $x$ and $y$:

$$x^2 + y^2 = (s\cos t)^2 + (s\sin t)^2 = s^2(\sin^2 + \cos^2) = s^2 = z^2$$

So the surface is a paraboloid.

### Question 3

$$\vec r(s,t) = \langle 3\cos t, s, \sin t\rangle$$
$$-1\le s\le 1$$

#### Solution

We can see that in this equation, $y$ is only determined by $s$, and the others are only of $t$. This means we can ignore $y$ for now.

Again, we can recognize that there is a similarity to the $\sin^2 + \cos^2$ property, so we can try to define an equation that changes $x$ and $z$ to this property:

$$x^2 = 9\cos^2 t$$

$$9\cos^2 t + 9\sin^2 t = 9$$

$$z^2 = \sin^2 t \to (3z)^2 = 9\sin^2 t$$

$$x^2 + (3z)^2 = 9$$

This shows that any cross-section of the surface will be an ellipse, and since y increases with s, the surface is a cylinder.

Since the equation goes from $[-1,1]$, the cylinder goes from $-1$ to $1$ in height.

### Question 4

Find parametric representation of the surface S:

$$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = a^2$$

#### Solution

In spherical coordinates:

$$
\begin{cases}
  x = \rho \cos \theta\sin\phi \\
  y = \rho\sin\theta\sin\phi \\
  z = \rho\cos\phi 
\end{cases}
$$

In spherical coordinates, we can say that a sphere is $\rho = a$. So, we can define the sphere as:

$$
\begin{cases}
  x = a \cos \theta\sin\phi \\
  y = a\sin\theta\sin\phi \\
  z = a\cos\phi 
\end{cases}
$$

We can simply define $\theta$ and $\phi$ as the other two parametric variables:

$$\vec r(\theta, \phi) = a\cos\theta\sin\phi\hat i + a\sin\theta\sin\phi \hat j + a\cos\phi\hat k$$

$$
\begin{vmatrix}
  0 \le \theta \le 2\pi \\
  0 \le \phi \le \pi
\end{vmatrix}
$$

### Question 5

S: is the plane thrrough the origin that contains the vectors $\hat i - \hat j$ and $\hat j - \hat k$.

#### Solution

First, let us define the equation of the plane by finding the normal:

$$
\vec n = (\hat i - \hat j)\times(\hat j - \hat k) = 
\begin{vmatrix}
  \hat i && \hat j && \hat k \\
  1 && -1 && 0 \\
  0 && 1 && -1
\end{vmatrix}
= \langle 1,1,1 \rangle
$$

So we can use that in the vector equation:

$$S: x + y + z = 0$$

$$\vec r(u,v) = u\hat i + v\hat j + (-u - v)\hat k$$

This is found by simply setting $x$ and $y$ equal to $u$ and $v$, then solving for $z$.
